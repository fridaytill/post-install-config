Help topics are for when users need to create a ticket. It helps the person handling the ticket better assess the issue needing to resolved. Make sure you are in the Admin Panel. Click manage. Click on help topics. Here you will be able to create different help topics based on common issues within the organization. Also, it is helpful to add a "other" help topic is the issue happens to be not so common.
